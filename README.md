# NWPU-Traffic
We have released our annotated NWPU-Traffic dataset at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LobucN-znqknQrHJs0_jZcqJfAaqt1qz?hl=zh-cn , which is the first comprehensive remote sensing dataset covering cars, ships, airplanes, and trains. We have already released the code we proposed.
This code is based on GeoSeg https://github.com/WangLibo1995/GeoSeg . We would like to express our gratitude for these excellent works.
